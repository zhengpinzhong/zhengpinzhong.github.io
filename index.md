# About Me

<img src="https://zhengpinzhong.github.io/images/zpz.jpg" class="floatpic" style="width: auto; height: 150px;" >

Here is **Pinzhong Zheng (郑品忠)**.

I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) under the supervision of [Prof. Zhi Zhou](https://sites.google.com/site/zhizhou0125/home). I previously earned an M.S. from the Department of Mathematics at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoming Wang](https://sites.mst.edu/wangxiaoming/), and a B.S. from the School of Mathematics and Statistics at Wuhan University (WHU). In 2024, before joining PolyU, I worked as a research assistant at the School of Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ), under the guidance of [Prof. Chaoyu Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/quanchaoyu/home). My research primarily focuses on numerical solutions to partial differential equations, especially the phase-field equations.
